# This manifest bootstraps a k8s cluster with services that should alwasy be
# installed, regardless of whether running on a cloud provider or locally. First
# it installs tiller, then installs cert-manager then nginx ingress. Because
# kapps must be installed in exactly that order, parallelism is disabled for
# this manifest.
#
# This manifest could be a good place to put other universal, cluster-wide
# kapps, e.g. for pod security policies, RBAC, etc.

# Kapps listed under this key will be installed if they are not currently
# installed in the target cluster.
options:
  parallelisation: 1      # kapps in this manifest must be installed in order,
                          # so disable parallelism for this manifest

  # The default installer for manifests is stored in config so we don't need

  - id: cert-manager       # Globally-unique identifier. For helm this corresponds
    # to the release name. If that's too restrictive we could
    # generate a globally-unique identifier based on the
    # manifest, but for now we'll keep it simple.
    # todo - make the above manifest-unique and be the kapp name. Make the
    # kapp ID be "<manifest_id>-<kapp_id>" and allow kapp IDs to be explicitly overridden..
    # Make the kapp ID be the helm release name.

    # Sources to checkout as siblings in the cache for this kapp. This allows

    # separately versioned source.
