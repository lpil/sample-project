# This creates infrastructure that must exist before launching a kops cluster.
# It creates an S3 bucket for Terraform remote state (not strictly necessary
# but a fiddly task that should be done before running any other kapps) and
# a hosted zone. It should be run as an initManifest so it gets executed before
# creating a cluster.
#
# If you're running on a different provider, you could either reimplement these
# kapps for your provider or create a `terraform_<provider>` directory in each
# one so a single kapp can support multiple clouds.
options:
  parallelisation: 1      # kapps in this manifest must be installed in order,
  # so disable parallelism for this manifest
